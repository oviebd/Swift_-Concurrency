# Part 01 - Convert a callback function into an Async function using Continuation.

## Overview
Callbacks can be effective but often lead to messy code. The introduction of async and await provides a streamlined and linear syntax for handling concurrent computations, resulting in cleaner and more readable code.

## Features
- Conversion of callback functions to async functions
- Improved code readability and cleanliness
